## Inspiration and Problem Statement
At the University of Washington, the course offerings are diverse, catering to a wide range of academic interests. However, amidst this abundance, students often find themselves struggling to navigate the myriad options available to them. Moreover, crucial information about these courses is dispersed across various platforms, making it challenging for students to access comprehensive details. Recognizing this issue, the Stumble not Fumble team has developed Graspâ€”a comprehensive solution aimed at simplifying the course discovery process for University of Washington students. Grasp serves as a centralized hub where students can find and share information about courses, empowering them to make well-informed decisions about their academic pursuits.
